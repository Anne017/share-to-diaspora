# Share to diaspora*

Share to diaspora* compatible social sites app for Ubuntu touch devices.

## What does it do?

When installed, the Share menu for links will have a new entry to share to diaspora*. Sharing will launch a webview window to the designated pod. Sharing is done via pod bookmarklets.

## Limitations

Due to an [upstream bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/webbrowser-app/+bug/1571361), shared page title is not delivered by webbrowser-app. This app already tries to use the title, so once that bug is fixed, things should work.
